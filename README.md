# Program 3 – Python Fundamentals

A collection of three introductory Python programs demonstrating arithmetic, conditional logic, validation, and user interaction.  
Each script builds on core programming concepts covered in early coursework.

## Program 1 – Payroll Calculator (`program3_1.py`)

### Description
A Python program that calculates regular pay, overtime pay, and total weekly pay based on user input.  
Demonstrates arithmetic operations, conditional branching, and formatted output.

### Features
- Accepts user input for hourly pay rate and hours worked.
- Calculates regular and overtime pay (time and a half beyond 40 hours).
- Displays each value with currency formatting.
- Ensures output clarity using formatted f-strings.

### Files
- `program3_1.py` — complete implementation:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

### Notes
- Reinforces use of conditional statements (`if` / `else`) and formatted numeric output.
- Demonstrates variable initialization and decision-making logic.

## Program 2 – Odd Multiples of 19 (`program3_2.py`)

### Description
A Python program that validates user input to check if an entered integer is one of the odd multiples of 19 between 60 and 200.  
Demonstrates conditional comparisons and input validation.

### Features
- Stores valid multiples (95, 133, and 171) as constants.
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Displays whether the input matches any valid multiple.
- Reinforces use of Boolean logic and relational operators.

### Files
- `program3_2.py` — complete implementation:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Notes
- Uses compound conditional logic (`or` operators) for multiple valid comparisons.
- Demonstrates numeric validation and simple error feedback.

## Program 3 – Two-Digit Integer Comparison (`program3_3.py`)

### Description
A Python program that validates two-digit integers entered by the user and computes their difference.  
Demonstrates nested conditionals, integer range checks, and formatted console output.

### Features
- Prompts the user to enter a two-digit integer.
- Rejects inputs less than 10 or greater than 99.
- If valid, prompts for a second two-digit integer and compares the two.
- Calculates the difference and displays the result with context.

### Files
- `program3_3.py` — complete implementation:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### Notes
- Reinforces range checking and nested `if` statements.
- Demonstrates user input, data conversion, and formatted string output.

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer

### Execution
Each script can be run separately from the command line:
```bash
python program3_1.py
python program3_2.py
python program3_3.py
